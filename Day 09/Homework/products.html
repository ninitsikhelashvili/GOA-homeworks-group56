<h2><u>WHAT ARE CREDIT/DEBIT CARDS</u></h2>
<p>Credit cards give you access to a line of credit issued by a bank, while debit cards deduct money directly from your bank account.
    <br> Credit cards offer better consumer protections against fraud compared with debit cards linked to a bank account.</p>
