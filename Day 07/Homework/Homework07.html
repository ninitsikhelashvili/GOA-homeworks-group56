<h1>Talk to me</h1>
<p>this is a warning <strong>dont watch this movie if you have a weak heart</strong></p>
<h2>what is this movie about? you may be asking yourself after reading the warning.</h2>
<p>When a group of friends discover how to conjure spirits using an embalmed hand, they become hooked on the new thrill, <br>until one of them goes too far and unleashes terrifying supernatural forces</p>
<p>so on a scale from 1-10 i would rate this movie a <u>7.5</u></p>
<p>yes it is really good. the acting is on point, but there sare some things i would change; For example:
    <br>i would make the movie scarier; the special effects are amazing and and as i already mentioned the acting was on point.
</p>
<p>but it didnt exceed my expectations.</p>

<h1>The Conjuring</h1>

<h2>The description.</h2>
<h3>warning: <b>this movie is not for the weak</b></h3>
<p>so the conjuring is a pretty scary movie if you get scared easily. 
    <br>i have to say, it scared me a little, but not as much as sinister.
</p>
<p><i>plot</i></p>
<p>Plot. In 1968, renowned demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren investigate the Annabelle case, in which friends Debbie and Camilla have a possessed doll. They allowed the spirit, who claimed to be a seven-year-old girl named Annabelle Higgins,
    <br> to possess the doll, but the hauntings became more disturbing.</p>
<p>i do have some <u>recomendations</u> for this movie as well</p>
<p>so <b>first and formemost</b> acting needed to be better.
     <br>it wasnt realistic enought which made the plot less interesting and less scary.
     also, as this movie is really old we have to take in the cosideration that special effects werent andvanced. but apart from acting the effects did really help 
     as surprising as that may sound.

    <h1>Amityville Horror</h1>
    <h2>The description</h2>
    <p><u>reccomendation</u></p>
    <p>2005's update on the classic Amityville legend came in the form of 'The Amityville Horror'. SYNOPSIS: 'Newlyweds are terrorized by demonic forces 
        <br>after moving into a large house that was the site of a grisly mass murder a year before.
    </p>
<p>so everything was perfect in this movie apart from one thing.</p>
<p>it was very very <u>confusing</u></p>
<p>so in the movie there are some parts that may confusee a lot of viewers.
     <br>now i dont want to spoil everything, but i have to admit the plot was <i>perfect</i>
     aslo the acting <b>amazing</b>
