<p>there are 6 players on the court</p>

<p>and all of them have different positions</p>
<p>but 2 players share a position</p>
<p>theres obviously the setter</p>
<p>so called 'spine'</p>
<p>theres also rightside hitter and opposite hitters</p>
<p>and there are 2 middle blockers</p>
<p>and last but not least the outside hitter</p>
<p>there are some rules in volleyball</p>
<p>for example: libero cant play if both middle blockers are on the court</p>
<p>liberos job is to save ball and not let it hit the ground</p>

<button>libero</button>
<p>personally i think the setters have the hardest jobs </p>
<p>when i used to play i was an opposite hitter</p>
<p>meaning i had to attack the rival team</p>
<p>the jumping can put a lot of pressure on knees </p>
<p>it requires a lot of lower body strenght to jump high and manage to hit the ball</p>
<p>i really miss playing and want to go back</p>
<p>but i also have to take care of my health</p>
<p>stay safe out there yall</p>
<p>sad face</p>
